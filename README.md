## Overview

The project required me to converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. A static design which lacked accessibility is converted to responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. For offline experience, a service worker is also added.

## How to run the project

To run the project, download or clone the repository in your computer

- Open the project. Navigate to the project folder or simply open the folder in an editor.

- Launch the index.html with a local server. You can achieve this by :
  a) In a terminal or window terminal, check the version of Python `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000` or `python -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
  b) Open the file with tools such aslive server (in VS Codes), etc

- With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000` or your own local host
